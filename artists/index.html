            <p class="description"> My favorite artist is Banksy for many reasons. I enjoy street art very much and banksy is one of the most known and respected true street artists known today. He has messages and meanings behind every work of art he produces. While his identity remains a mystery, his work is put up around the world. He even has works fetching six figures in fine art collections without seeing a penny. </p>
