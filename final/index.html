    <h2> Why should you wash YOUR car?</h2>
    
        <p> There are many added benefits to washing your car, from it being more valuable when selling it to it simply looking better and lasting longer. Here are our top 5 reasons to keep your car clean! </p>
    
        <dl>
            <dt> 1. More Money for you! </dt>
                <dd> Have you given up on your current car? You've stopped doing that monthly garden hose spray, and stopped caring about that coffee spill you told yourself you'd clean up when you got home? <br>
                    
                There might be a benefit to putting a little work one more time! <br>
                    
                According to Alec Gutierrez, manager of vehicle valuation for Kelly Blue Book. "You could probably negotiate an extra $300 to $500 if it's properly cleaned." <br>
                
                We think thats pretty impressive, just taking a hour or two and a couple of bucks at your local auto store could get you a few hundred dollars, thats a good turn around if ive heard one!
                </dd>
            
            <dt> 2. Brand new look! </dt>
                <dd> You know you love when you step in a car and it still has that original new car smell. They even sell air freshners called 'New Car smell'! But you dont need to go out to the dealership and buy one everytime your car stops looking like it rolled off the lot. All you need to do is give it a good wash, wipe down the inside, and vacuum. Maybe add one of those new car smelling air freshners. </dd>
            <dt> 3. Dirt Damages! </dt>
                <dd> Everyone one knows that dirty cars aren't appealing, but dirt can actually damage your car. People who live in the North know it is no joke when it comes spring time to wash your car. The salt from ice melting builts up on the car and can actually eat right through your paint and any exposed metals underneath. Leaving you throwing sparks down the highway when your frame splits! <br> 
                Okay maybe not, but you get the point! Dirt can act as a sandpaper grinding down on your clear coat. This can make your car paint dull and scratched, and even go through the paint to create rust spots, that is a whole new problem and expensive problem! </dd>
            <dt> 4. Less Gas!</dt>
                <dd> Did you know that a clean car is more fuel efficient? <br> 
            
                According to some people, somewhere, there are people out there who think dirt on a car creates a aerodynamic effect similar to a golf ball with its dimples. Interesting theory none-the-less. <br>
                    
                The real facts are that dirt creates drag making your car work harder, using more fuel for the same distance. According to some research and experiments done by the poeple over at MythBusters, a clear car could see a increase in fuel economy by around 10 percent! Thats pretty impressive and good reasoning to clean your car!
                </dd>
            <dt> 5. Long Life! </dt>
                <dd>  Okay, maybe I gave some extreme scenarios but I think there were some good points made. Maybe you aren't selling your car anytime soon or even car about that new car smell. But, its just good practise to have a clean car. It will save you money in the long run and makes you feel good no matter what type of car you are driving. </dd>
