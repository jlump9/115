    <h2> Proper washing technique. </h2>
        <p> Most of the swirl marks that disfigure your vehicle are likely caused by poor washing technique. Thorough weekly washes and careful hand-drying can be the best care you can give your vehicle. Improper techniques will cause unsightly swirls and scratches in the paint requiring compounding or polishing at the very least. You can eliminate these problems and save yourself extra work by following a few simple tips when washing and drying your vehicle. </p>
        
        <dl> 
            <dt> Step 1: </dt>
                <dd> Make sure  your car is parked in a shaded area. Direct sunlight will cause water and cleaners to dry too quickly creating spots. </dd>
            <dt> Step 2: </dt>
                <dd> Prepare your wash buckets. I like to use two 5 gallon buckets with Grit Gaurds on the bottom. Fill both with water and add your car wash to one of the buckets. I personally use Meguirs Wash and Wax. You can learn more about why I use it on the <a href="tools.html"> tools page. </a> </dd> 
            <dt> Step 3: </dt>
                <dd> Spray down the vehicle with water, this gets off any loose dirt allowing the wash solution to work on the tough spots. </dd>
            <dt> Step 4: </dt>
                <dd> Take your microfiber wash mitt and dunk it into your plain water bucket, then ring it out and dunk it into the washing solution bucket. Starting from the top panels such as the roof and hood begin to wash the vehicle.</dd>
            <dt> Step 5: </dt>
                <dd> After one or two panels. Spray them off so the soap does not dry on the paint. Take your mitt and dunk it into the clean water removing the dirt so you wash solution doesnt become dirty. Then redunk it into the wash solution bucket. You are going to repeat these steps until the car has been cleaned. </dd>
            <dt> Step 6: </dt>
                <dd> Using a microfiber drying towel dry the entire car ensuring no water spots get left. </dd>
        </dl>
    <h3> Bonus Tips! </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Use a BUG PAD if tar, bugs, or tough grime wont come off.</li>
            <li> When cleaning windows, ALWAYS use ammonia free glass cleaner, it will eat tint, and UV films. </li>
            <li> Never use plain dish soap! While it cleans great, it cleans so well that it will strip all protectants on your paint as well </li>
            <li> Only use Microfiber products, your paint is sensative, regular cloth can scratch and leave swirls. Microfiber is gentle enough to not mare your paint. </li>
        </ul>
