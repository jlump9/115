    <h2> The inside is just as important! </h2>
        <p> Other people may admire the outside your vehicle, but you see the inside every time you drive. Depending on how you use your vehicle, the interior may need even more TLC than the paint! This guide will take you through the basics of interior care. After all, it’s what’s on the inside that counts! </p>
    
        <dl>
            <dt> Step 1: </dt>
                <dd> To start, I just like to open all the doors. Look in all the seatbacks, door sides, and the center console to remove all the trash I have acumilated. Then take out all the floor mats. </dd>
            <dt> Step 2: </dt>
                <dd>  Begin by vacuuming the floorboard and the seats. Make sure you pull the seat apart where the seams meet, this is where dirt seems to get trapped most. Also the constant in and out with sand moving back and forth in those areas can act like sandpaper deteriating those stitches.  </dd>
            <dt> Step 3: </dt>
                <dd> Using Meguiars Interior Cleaner on everything you see! the door panels, dash, steering wheel, seats, etc. This product gives it UV protection. Preventing those cracks and discoloration, and cleaning it! <br>  Obviously you don't have to use this specific product but it's what I use, you can like always read why I use it on the TOOlS PAGE. </dd>
            <dt> Step 4: </dt>
                <dd> After wiping down anything in sight, give it all a good wipe down to remove any excess product. this gives it a nice matte finish and not shiny blinding reflections while you drive. </dd>
            <dt> Step 5: </dt>
                <dd> After all the insides are clean. Take those floor mats that you removed and shake them out. If need be give them a quick vaccum. If they rubber floor mats, you can hose them down. </dd>
            <dt> Step 6: </dt>
                <dd> All you need to do now is place the floor mats back in and add a air-freshner if you need one! </dd>

    <h3> Bonus Tips! </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> If you have leather seats, consider using a specalized leather cleaner. </li>
            <li> Interior glass is just as important as exterior glass. Use the same AMMONIA FREE glass cleaner as the outside. </li>
